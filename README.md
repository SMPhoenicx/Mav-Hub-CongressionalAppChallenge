# The Mav Hub for The Congressional App Challenge 2025-26

A passion project created for the needs of our school's student body.

Suman Muppavarapu ('26) and Derek Jiu ('25) at St. John's School in Houston, Texas.

Borne out of the needs of the student body of our school, the Mav Hub aims to make life easier and more fun for everyone at St. John's, providing quick access to information, fun features, and the ability to connect with others at school. This app was an incredible project and has been published on the App Store with about 100,000 daily uses per month. 

We hope that the app can continue helping students and parents at our school for years to come and we are extremely grateful for this opportunity to aid our community using our skills.
